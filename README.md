# MarketDial's vue-contacts-app
We love all our co-workers here at MarketDial and want to create an address book to store everyone's contact info so we can keep in touch. We're excited that you're here just in time to help us with that task! Below is an outline of an MVP for our address book but we'd love for you to implement any creative ideas you may have on top of the requirements. Please do not spend more than two hours on the code for this project. Completion is not the goal but instead we'd like to use your code to give us an idea of how you approach and solve a variety of problems across the frontend. When finished with the project, upload it to a repo on your personal GitHub or GitLab account and share the link with us. We will review your code with you during your in-person interview at HQ to hear how you reached your decisions.

## // TODOs

	[x] Name (required)
	[x] Email
	[x] Phone Number

1. Format the list of contacts using Sass.
